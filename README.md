# MLTutorials
This repository contains a collection of machine learning tutorials that I created for the Accel.AI's blog.

The goal of these tutorials is to provide practical and accessible guidance for anyone who wants to learn or improve their machine learning skills.


The tutorials for this course were created using Jupyter Notebooks with Anaconda. Jupyter Notebooks are interactive web-based documents that allow you to write and run code, as well as add text, images, and other elements. Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of Python and R that comes with many packages and tools for data science and machine learning. By using Jupyter Notebooks with Anaconda, you can easily access and explore the data sets, libraries, and frameworks that you need for the tutorials.
